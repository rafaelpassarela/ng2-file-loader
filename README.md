# ng2-file-loader
This is a simple component for TypeScript/Angular2 that allow the read of a file selected by the user, in the client side, without submit or additional requests.

## Why?
I was sitting at my desk, doing my site in Typescript (by the way is <a href="http://mrrafael.ca/" target="_blank">mrrafael.ca</a>), when I came across a situation: loading and editing a JSON file, without sending it to the server, there, on the client side itself. Upload, edit and download again, quickly and without much delay.
To my surprise, I found something, but not the way I wanted it. I got what I found, I changed it, I changed that and banng!
A component for TypeScript (I know, one more :grimacing: ) has come up for use with Angular2.
